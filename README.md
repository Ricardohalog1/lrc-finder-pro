# üéµ LRC Finder Pro

**LRC Finder Pro** is a powerful and intuitive web-based utility designed to streamline the process of finding and downloading synchronized lyrics (.lrc files) for your entire local music library. By leveraging a hybrid search system, this tool automates the tedious task of searching for lyrics one by one‚Äîperfect for music lovers and karaoke masters alike.

üí° *Tip: This is the perfect spot for a video demo of the application in action!*

## ‚ú® Key Features

* üìÇ **Efficient Batch Processing**: Select an entire music folder. The app intelligently processes your files in batches to ensure smooth performance without crashing, even with thousands of songs.
* ‚ö° **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Prioritizes a high-speed **offline (local) server** for initial searches. If no results are found or the local server is unavailable, it seamlessly falls back to the **online `lrclib.net` API** for maximum reliability.
* ‚úçÔ∏è **Interactive Revision**: If the first match isn't perfect, click the **"Revise"** button to open a modal and choose the correct lyrics from a list of alternatives provided by the API.
* üîç **Inline Manual Search**: For tracks that weren't found, simply hover over the "Not Found" badge and click **"Manual Search"**. A modal will appear, allowing you to find lyrics without leaving the results page.
* üì¶ **One-Click ZIP Download**: Download all successfully found .lrc files in one neat .zip archive, conveniently named after your source folder.

## üöÄ Future Development: Native Android App

To provide a fully integrated, standalone experience, the next major goal for this project is to evolve it into a **native Android application using Android Studio**.

This architectural shift will involve:
* **Rebuilding the UI** with native Android components (XML or Jetpack Compose).
* **Rewriting the backend logic** (currently in PHP) in **Kotlin** or **Java**. This includes making direct API calls to `lrclib.net` from within the app.
* **Integrating all utilities**, including the File Renamer and a future Duplicate Song Remover, directly into the app using native Android APIs for file system access.

This will result in a true, installable mobile application that no longer requires a separate web server.

## üêç Bonus Utility: File Renamer

Included in the suite is a standalone Python script (`file_renamer.py`) to clean and standardize your music filenames before processing.

* **Reads Metadata**: Extracts Artist and Title tags from `.mp3`, `.flac`, and `.m4a` files.
* **Intelligent Formatting**: Removes superfluous text (e.g., "Official Video," "Lyrics") and renames the file to a clean `Title - Artist.ext` format.
* **Improves Match Accuracy**: Using this script first significantly increases the success rate of the Batch Finder.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you will need:
* ‚úÖ **XAMPP** (or any Apache+PHP environment)
* ‚úÖ **Rust + Cargo** (for the optional offline API backend)
* ‚úÖ **Python 3** (for the optional file renamer script)

### Step 1: Set up the Offline lrclib Backend (Optional)

For the fastest search experience, you can host the lyrics database locally.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    * *Note: Use this specific fork as it contains fixes for local deployment.*
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/RiczzIoT/lrclib-fixed.git](https://github.com/RiczzIoT/lrclib-fixed.git)
    cd lrclib-fixed
    ```
2.  **Download the Database**: Obtain the latest database dump from [lrclib.net Database Dumps]([https://db-dumps.lrclib.net/](https://db-dumps.lrclib.net/lrclib-db-dump-20250718T081344Z.sqlite3.gz)).
3.  **Place the Database**: Extract the downloaded archive and move the `db.sqlite3` file into the `lrclib-fixed` directory.
4.  **Run the Server**:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release -- serve --database db.sqlite3
    ```
    The local API will now be running at `http://localhost:3300`.

### Step 2: Configure the PHP Web Application

1.  **Deploy Project Files**: Copy the entire `lrc-finder-pro` project folder into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\lrc-finder-pro`).
2.  **Start Apache**: Launch the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** service.
3.  **Access the App**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/lrc-finder-pro/`.

### Step 3: Clean Your Filenames (Optional but Recommended)

1.  Open `file_renamer.py` in a text editor.
2.  Change the `MUSIC_FOLDER` variable to the path of your music library.
3.  Run the script from your terminal: `python file_renamer.py`.
4.  This will rename your files to the optimal `Title - Artist.ext` format for best results.

## üìñ Usage Guide

1.  (Recommended) Run the **File Renamer** script on your music folder first.
2.  Navigate to the **Batch Finder** page (`index.php`).
3.  Click "Choose Files" and select your music folder.
4.  Hit "Scan for Lyrics" and watch the real-time progress.
5.  Review results:
    * Green "Synced"? You're good!
    * If a match is wrong, click **"Revise"** to pick a better one.
    * Red "Not Found"? Hover and click **"Manual Search"** to find it yourself.
6.  When ready, click **"Download All found (.zip)"** to grab your LRC files.
